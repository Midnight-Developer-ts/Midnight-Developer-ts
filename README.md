<h2 align="center" id="about-me">📖 About Midnight Developer</h2>
<h3 align="center">Who I Am Behind The Code</h3>

<p align="center">Hey! I’m <strong>Tiffany Schuman</strong>, online and professionally, I go by <strong>Midnight Developer</strong>. I’m a <strong>front-end web developer</strong> and I'm working towards my <strong>full-stack certifications</strong>. I specialize in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, combining creativity and technical skills together to build modern, unique, user-friendly websites.</p>

<p align="center">My hands-on experience so far includes building and maintaining a band's website, as well as developing personal and class projects to practice and showcase my skills. While most of my work has been small-scale, I'm eager to collaborate with both small businesses and larger companies to deliver fast, accessible, and visually engaging websites.</p>

<p align="center">Fueled by sweet tea and a love for problem-solving, turning tricky problems into organized, functional code. I’m committed to delivering results that help clients grow their online presence, and I'm always exploring new tech to improve my skills, my craft, and the online visuals that capture an audience.</p>

<p align="center">I have experience with <strong>e-commerce</strong> and <strong>CMS platforms</strong> including <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>Wix</strong>, <strong>Ionos</strong>, <strong>Hostinger</strong>, and <strong>eBay</strong>. I’ve also managed product listings, optimized content for SEO, embedded custom code, and maintained websites with timely updates, bug fixes, and new features as needed. Beyond development, I design logos, write SEO-driven content, and leverage AI tools to streamline workflows and enhance my coding solutions.</p>

<h2 align="center" id="what-i-do">🌐 What I Do</h2>

<p align="center">I design and build modern, responsive websites that are fast, accessible, and customized to each client’s goals. My work ranges from freelance projects, client sites such as band websites and business storefronts, to personal projects like social platforms and creative web experiments. I’m open to freelance projects, full-time web development opportunities, and creative collaborations, including open-source contributions.</p>

<p align="center">I combine creativity with functionality to bring a unique “Midnight Vibe” aesthetic when it fits while keeping designs clean, modern, and user-friendly. My signature touches are subtle animations and micro-interactions that make sites feel alive. Strong attention to typography, color harmony, cohesive branding. Intuitive navigation and calls-to-action that guide users naturally. Focus on performance, accessibility, and SEO. Every site I build is customized to reflect the client’s unique identity never looking like a cookie-cutter concept. I keep communication transparent throughout the process and deliver a site that balances performance with personality giving you exceptional results.</p>
